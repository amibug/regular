# regular = react(ractive) + angular.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/regularjs/regular.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/regularjs/regular)

regularjs is a live template engine helping us to create interactive component.

__features__

1. __data-binding__ based on dirty-check
2. __string-based template__ 
3. __independent lifecycle__ —— can be integrated with whatever framework you already used.
4. __nested component__
5. class-based component. just like [angular-classy](http://davej.github.io/angular-classy/) do for angular
6. powerfull animation supported ([blog](http://regularjs.github.io/blog/2014/07/26/2014-7-26-animation-rethink/))
7. __directive, filter, event__ is supported, and extend easily.

## Take a glance at regularjs

with the code that less than 20 line , a simple noteapp is done. check the result on [jsfiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/leeluolee/e6yD3/)

__template__

```html
{{#list notes as c}}
  <p>{{c.content}}<a href='#' on-click={{this.remove(c)}}>remove</a></p>
{{/list}}
<textarea r-model={{draftComment}}></textarea>
<button on-click={{this.add()}}>new Note</button>
```

__javascript__
```javascript
var NoteApp = Regular.extend({
  template: "#todos",
  remove: function(index){
    this.data.notes.splice(index,1);
  },
  add: function(){
    var data = this.data;
    data.notes.push({ content: data.draftComment})
    data.draftComment = "";
  }
});

new NoteApp({ data: {notes:[] }}).inject(document.body);
```
